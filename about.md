I'm a software engineer from the Detroit, MI area. I'm passionate about building solid web applications in PHP. I'm also a passable Javascript developer who really enjoys AngularJS and a dash of Node from time to time.

I work at Quicken Loans in downtown Detroit. It's really a great place to work! If you want to work with me, drop me a line. We're still looking for smart people to work on fun projects.

I strive to know what I don't know. I always want to keep improving my skills and getting better at what I do. I look forward to figuring things out, and maybe jotting down some notes once and a while when I stumble across something you might find interesting as well!
